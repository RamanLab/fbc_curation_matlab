# fbc_curation_matlab
fbc_curation contains MATLAB/COBRA helpers for reproducibility of fbc models.

## Installation
Just download the single script [`fbc_curation.m` from the `src/curator` directory](https://github.com/RamanLab/fbc_curation_matlab/blob/main/src/fbc_curation/curator/fbc_curation.m).

## Example Output
```
>> fbc_curation('e_coli_core.xml');
